# This is how Hello world get's print in Python.
print("hello world")
print("Day 1 - Printing Excercise\nPython by Angela Yu\nprint('Work here')")
# here '\n' is used to insert a new line.

# Input() will get the user input in console.
# Print will print the word "hello" with the user input.
print("hello " + input("What is your name ") + " !")

# we can use 'len' to calculate the length of string.
print(len(input("What is your name? ")))

# we use variables to assign them a value which we can use in future.
name = "Ashish"
print(name)
# This will print Ashish in the console, but what if we change 'name' variable's value to something else. See below
name = "Dhruvi"
print(name)
# Now this will print Dhruvi as output.
